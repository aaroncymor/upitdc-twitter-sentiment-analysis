# upitdc-twitter-sentiment-analysis

## Objective
	The objective of this project is to appreciate
	data analysis using twitter data (not live), and
	familiarize javascript libraries which are jQuery,
	High Maps, High Charts, and Porter Stemmer. The
	twitter data was not included in the repo since it 
	is a very large file.

## Instructions
	Using twitter data and porter stemmer, calculate
	for the points per tweet and determine if it is
	'happy', 'sad', or 'neutral'.
	
	With high charts, graph the following data:
		> top 10 most used hashtags
		> top 10 most used words
		> top 10 happiest countries
	
	With high maps:
		>highlight the top 10 happiest countries
